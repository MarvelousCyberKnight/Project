    <b style="font-size: 130%;"> <p>
        <b>=></b> The Department of Civil Engineering established in the year 1979, is one of the oldest department in the Institute offering B.Tech. degree. The current approved annual intake of the department is 120. The department has been accredited
    thrice by the NBA. The department has been producing some of the best civil engineers for more than 3.5 decades.<br><br><b>=></b> The department has been offering the finest and unparalleled quality of civil engineering education not only in the district
    but also in the entire JNTUA region. The students graduating from the department every year are occupying some of the top positions in the government and private sectors both within and outside the country, and are also heading their own enterprises.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>=></b> The B.Tech Programme in Civil Engineering offered by the Department has been accredited by NBA for the fourth time under Tier-I for three years. NBA Expert Team visited the campus during 11-13 November 2016 and evaluated all the five
        Departments of ECE, EEE, CSE, Civil and Mechanical Engineering under Tier-I System. All the five Departments have been accredited under Tier-I for the years 2016 -’17, 2017-’18 and 2018-’19 up to 30-06-2019.
    </p>
    <p><b>=></b>Emphasis on practical education coupled with strong concept oriented teaching-learning process has been the backbone of the department ever since its inception. The excellent infrastructure is further an added advantage.</p>
    <p><b>=></b>The department has ten well established laboratories housed spaciously with excellent natural lighting and ventilation. All the laboratories are well maintained by technically qualified personnel. During the practical classes, every student
        is trained to individually handle and use the equipment in all the laboratories to get complete hands-on experience.<br><br><b>=></b> A unique survey camp is conducted every year to make the students thoroughly understand the practical concepts
        of surveying using the most modern survey equipment. The department also offers coursework in GIS and GPS with practical training in the use of relevant software and equipment. The Computer Aided Analysis and Design (CAAD) laboratory is fully
        equipped with licensed software for drawing plans, structural analysis and design, structural drawings and quantity estimation.<br><br><b>=></b> The department has separate fully equipped laboratories for structural engineering, highway engineering,
        concrete technology, geotechnical engineering, environmental engineering and geology along with CAAD laboratory. Apart from regular curriculum, these laboratories are thoroughly utilized by every student for carrying out their final year project
        works. Some of the student projects are also getting published as research papers in international journals. </p>
    <p>
        <b>=></b> In several technical and paper presentation contests conducted throughout the country, the students of this department have been winning a good number of prizes every year. The department also conducts an annual national level paper
        presentation contest drawing students from several engineering colleges. The individual attention given to students in the academic and other student-related activities has been immensely helpful in keeping the civil engineering students of NBKRIST
        stay far ahead of students graduating from other Institutes.
    </p>
    <p><b>=></b>The department conducts faculty development programs (FDP) for the teachers to update their domain knowledge. The teaching staff of the department is also encouraged to attend seminars, conferences, workshops, summer schools and short-term
        training programs. As part of its social responsibility, the department has been conducting programs to train personnel from construction industry.</p>
    <p><b>=></b>The department has a strong consultancy wing offering services in all specializations of civil engineering to several government and private companies all over the state over the last three decades.</p>
